# Astris - AI-Powered Discord Bot

Astris is an AI-integrated chatbot for Discord, powered by the Groq API and Google's Gemma 2  model. It can generate AI responses in a specific channel and also moderate messages to prevent offensive content, and even host a text-based battle game for users to enjoy.

## Features
- **AI Chatbot**: Uses Groq's API to generate responses from the `gemma2-9b-it` model.
- **Channel-Specific Responses**: The bot only replies in a designated channel.
- **Message Moderation**: Deletes messages containing banned words and notifies users via DM.
- **Text-Based Battle Game**: Players can spawn enemies, attack them, and battle in real-time with a simple `!battle` and `attack` command system.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (Latest LTS recommended)
- Discord bot token
- Groq API key
